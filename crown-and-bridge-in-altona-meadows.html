                    <h4>What are Dental Crowns and Tooth Bridges?</h4>
                    <p>A custom-made crown or “cap” completely covers the top of a tooth. Crowns not only repair and
                        strengthen a damaged tooth but can improve the appearance. Bridges are similar to crowns but
                        they replace one or more missing teeth making it easier to chew and also enhance the appearance.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How do Crowns work?</h4>
                    <p>A crown is used to entirely cover or “cap” a damaged tooth. Besides strengthening a damaged
                        tooth, a crown can be used to improve its appearance, shape or alignment. A crown can also be
                        placed on top of an implant to provide a tooth-like shape and structure for function. Porcelain
                        or ceramic crowns can be matched to the colour of your natural teeth.</p>
                    <p>Other materials include gold and metal alloys, acrylic and ceramic. These alloys are generally
                        stronger than porcelain and may be recommended for back teeth. Porcelain bonded to a metal shell
                        is often used because it is both strong and attractive.</p>
                    <p><b>A Crown may be recommended to:</b></p>

                    </div>

                    <h4>How do Bridges Work?</h4>
                    <p>A bridge may be recommended if you’re missing one or more teeth. Gaps left by missing teeth
                        eventually cause the remaining teeth to rotate or shift into the empty spaces, resulting in a
                        bad bite. The imbalance caused by missing teeth can also lead to gum disease and
                        temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.</p>
                    <p>Bridges are commonly used to replace one or more missing teeth. They span the space where the
                        teeth are missing. Bridges are cemented to the natural teeth or implants surrounding the empty
                        space. These teeth, called abutments, serve as anchors for the bridge. A replacement tooth,
                        called a pontic, is attached to the crowns that cover the abutments.</p>
                    <p>As with crowns, you have a choice of materials for bridges. Your dentist can help you decide
                        which to use, based on the location of the missing tooth (or teeth), its function, aesthetic
                        considerations and cost. Porcelain or ceramic bridges can be matched to the colour of your
                        natural teeth.</p>
                    <p><b>NOTE: </b>Your dentist may recommend implants as a means of replacing missing teeth. Implants
                        can replace missing teeth without the need to touch or restore adjacent teeth next to space.
                        Please refer to the section on Dental Implants.</p>

                    <h4>How are Crowns and Bridges Made?</h4>
                    <p>Before either a crown or a bridge can be made, the tooth (or teeth) must be reduced in size so
                        that the crown or bridge will fit over it properly like a thimble fitting over a peg. After
                        reducing the tooth/teeth, your dentist will take an impression to provide an exact mould for the
                        crown or bridge. If porcelain is to be used, your dentist will determine the correct shade for
                        the crown or bridge to match the colour of your existing teeth.</p>
                    <p>Using this impression, a dental lab then makes your crown or bridge, in the material your dentist
                        specifies. A temporary crown or bridge will be put in place to cover the prepared tooth while
                        the permanent crown or bridge is being made. When the permanent crown or bridge is ready, the
                        temporary crown or bridge is removed, and the new crown or bridge is cemented over your prepared
                        tooth or teeth.</p>
