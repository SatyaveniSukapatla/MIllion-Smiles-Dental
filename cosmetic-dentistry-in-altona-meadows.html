                    <h4>What are Veneers?</h4>
                    <p>Veneers are a thin layer of porcelain that is bonded to the surface of the tooth to improve its
                        esthetics or to protect a damaged tooth. Veneers require minimal and in some cases no removal of
                        the tooth structure.</p>
                    <p>Veneers or porcelain laminates are like acrylic or gel fingernails and can be used to close
                        spaces, mask stain & discolouring, cover chipping, correct misshapen or crooked teeth.</p>
                    <h4>What treatments or problems are Veneers used for?</h4>
                    <p>There are a wide variety of reasons why patients opt for treatment with dental veneers:</p>

                    <p><img src="images/check.png" alt="check-icon"><b>Stained teeth–</b>badly stained teeth that
                        cannot be improved by teeth whitening or prophyflex treatments can be greatly improved by
                        dental veneers, which function to cover any existing stains on your teeth.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/check.png" alt="check-icon"><b>Damaged teeth–</b>teeth that have become
                        badly worn through excessive grinding or by carbonated drinks, as well as those that have
                        been chipped or broken, can benefit from veneers. A small chip on a tooth can quickly be
                        repaired with composite bonding, also known as “composite veneers”.</p>
                    <p>A single damaged tooth can easily be repaired with a porcelain veneer that has the same
                        characteristics and colour as your natural teeth.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/check.png" alt="check-icon"><b>Gaps–spaces or gaps (diastemas)</b> between
                        your teeth can easily be closed using dental veneers, giving you a more uniform-looking
                        smile.</p>
                    <p><img src="images/check.png" alt="check-icon"><b>Crooked teeth–</b> Veneers are not the ideal
                        treatment for crooked teeth, and from the point of view of preserving your natural teeth
                        structure, orthodontics would probably a better solution. However, such treatments can take up
                        to a year or longer.</p>
                    <p>For teeth that are not severely crooked, veneers
                        placed over their front surface will give a straight and perfectly aligned-looking smile.
                        For this type of treatment, many people refer to veneers as “Instant Orthodontics”, as you
                        get a similar end result in a fraction of the time.</p>
